<p>Welcome! This playground aims to understand the BrainFuck language, sometimes called BF. The language is really simple to learn, as there are only 8 instructions. It is also a Turing-complete language, so you can virtually implement any algorithm using BF. However,programs are said to be a bit complex.</p>

<p>Brainfuck, language itself, is a Turing-complete language created by Urban Müller. The language only consists of 8 operators, yet with the 8 operators, &lt;&gt;+- [],. you are capable of writing almost any program you can think of. To write programs in brainfuck, i would suggest you get a few things first.</p>

<p>Brainfuck Background. According to Wikipedia, Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1992, and notable for its extreme minimalism. As people have implemented more and more ridiculous programs with the language, it has become relatively well-known over the years. Nowadays some see it as the ultimate coding challenge to create &hellip;</p>

<p>Created in 1993 by a Swiss physics student named Urban Müller, Brainfuck was an attempt to create a language with the smallest possible compiler. A compiler is a computer program that translates code written in a high-level programming language into something that can be understood by a machine. The closer a programming language is to the &hellip;</p>

<p>Brainfuck is an extremely minimalistic, fully competent, Turing-complete esoteric programming language created in 1993 as more of a theoretical joke rather than a tool for real-world software development. With just 8 extremely simple commands, Brainfuck code can be used to write algorithms performing virtually any computational task possible.</p>

<p>Definitely. It&rsquo;s not really useful to write significant programs in, but it&rsquo;s definitely useful if you want to practice to build an interpreter or a compiler, since the language is very simple. It&rsquo;s not really useful for practical purposes, but can be useful for pedagogical purposes, and as a technique for proving Turing-completeness. That is &hellip;</p>

<li>IMO, the goals of the Brainfuck language are. To demonstrate what a practical language should NOT look like; To demonstrate that even a poorly-designed language can be Turing-complete; To brag in front of your programmer friends, e.g. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written a calculator in Brainfuck!&rdquo; To &ldquo;f*ck (~= train) your brains&rdquo; and getting practice.</li>

<p>Output : GEEKS FOR GEEKS. Applications of brainfuck: 1) Brainfuck does not have a lot of practical uses. 2) It&rsquo;s creator Urban Müller designed brainfuck with the goal of implementing it with the smallest possible compiler. 3) Esoteric programming languages are usually used to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as &hellip;</p>
