<p>Lingua::Shakespeare 1.00. Programming language. Shakespeare is an esoteric programming language, in which programs resemble plays by Shakespeare. The language was created by Kalle Hasselström and Jon Åslund as part of their programming assignment in Syntax Analysis course. A couple of weeks before the authors discovered for themselves the &hellip;</p>

<p>The Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) is an esoteric programming language created by Karl Hasselström and Jon Åslund in 2001. The design goal of Shakespeare was, according to the Manual, to make a language with beautiful source code that resembled Shakespeare plays. Contents. 1 Language Overview. 1.1 Title;</p>

<p>The Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL) is a programming language with source code that looks like Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays. The language is Turing complete, so theoretically just as powerful as any other language. It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to write but not very practical. More info can be found on Wikipedia. Note: Shakespeare&rsquo;s actual plays are not &hellip;</p>

<p>Here a brief explanation of the basic and fundamental constructs of the language is given. The Shakespeare Programming Language is different from the ordinary languages. It has got a wonderful syntax. The programs resemble the Shakespearian plays. The whole program is arranged as dialogues between the different characters in the play.</p>

<p>Here is the code for the &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo; program (the simplest program in any language, which simply displays the phrase &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo;) in Shakespeare: Romeo, a young man with a remarkable patience. Juliet, a likewise young woman of remarkable grace. Ophelia, a remarkable woman much in dispute with Hamlet. Hamlet, the flatterer of Ophelia.</p>

<p>Today while browsing Code Golf, I discovered a language based on Shakespeare known as the Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL).. While trying to understand how the language worked, I came across the Wikipedia entry for SPL, which included example code for the &ldquo;Standard &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo; program&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m having a hard time understanding how this code works.</p>
