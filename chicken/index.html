<p>For &lsquo;fun&rsquo; I&rsquo;m trying to understand the esoteric programming language Chicken, but just can&rsquo;t seem to get it.The Hello World example is the one I&rsquo;m trying to fully understand. Many sites refer to torso.me/Chicken, but that site, unfortunately, seems down.. Using the Hello World code available at Esolang, I have a few questions: Q1: At line 12, 13, and 14 there are 10, 17, and 3 chickens.</p>

<p>November 12, 2023 Steve Emms CLI, Programming. CHICKEN is a compiler for the Scheme programming language. It translates Scheme source files into C, which in turn can be fed to a C compiler to generate a standalone executable. An interpreter is also available and can be used as a scripting environment or for testing programs before compilation.</p>

<p>Programming. For those who haven&rsquo;t used it (and those who question Scheme&rsquo;s viability as a language to be used on &ldquo;real&rdquo; or &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; projects), Chicken is a pretty great option for writing non-toy software. It has tons of community-contributed libraries and it does (as the author mentions in the article) make it dirt simple to call out to C &hellip;</p>
