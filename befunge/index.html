<p>Befunge -93 is a stack-based programming language, the programs for which are arranged in a two-dimensional torus grid. The program execution sequence starts at the top left corner and proceeds to the right until the first direction instruction is met (which can appear in the very first cell). The torus adjective means that the program never &hellip;</p>

<p>Befunge. Befunge is one of the oldest and the most famous two-dimensional esoteric programming languages. Befunge was created in 1993 by Chris Pressey. He attempted to create a language which would be as hard to compile as possible. However, in next years quite a lot of implementations of this language appeared, as well as several dialects and &hellip;</p>

<p>Befunge is a programming language with some very unusual standards, as a two-dimensional, self-modifying, stack-based programming language. Apparently, it was designed in 1993 by Chris Pressey, merely to be as difficult to compile as possible. All operations in Befunge are limited to a single character, and the source text can be traversed in &hellip;</p>

<p>Befunge is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language. It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid. &ldquo;Arrow&rdquo; instructions direct the control flow to the left, right, up or down, and loops are constructed by sending the control flow in a cycle. It has been described as &ldquo;a cross between Forth and Lemmings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Befunge is an esoteric programming language by Chris Pressey. Chris Pressey invented Befunge in 1993 with the goal of defining a language that is as difficult to compile as possible. A difficulty for compilers is for example the p-command, which can dynamically change the program at runtime. The program consists of ASCII characters in an 80×25 &hellip;</p>

<p>Listed below are all of the tasks on Rosetta Code which have been solved using Befunge. Befunge is an esoteric programming language invented by Chris Pressey in 1993. It is unusual for having a two-dimensional toroidal code space. Commands are single characters, and the instruction pointer can move up, down, left, and right across the source.</p>
